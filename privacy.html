            <p class="page-tagline">Last updated: February 2026</p>

            <p>At DigiBouquet, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect when you use our website, how we use that information, and the choices you have regarding your data. By using DigiBouquet, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>DigiBouquet is designed to be used without creating an account. We do not require you to register, log in, or provide any personal information to create and share digital bouquets. The bouquets you create are generated using client-side technology in your browser, and the content of your personalized cards and messages is not stored on our servers.</p>
            <p>However, we do automatically collect certain non-personal information when you visit our website. This includes standard usage data such as your IP address, browser type and version, operating system, referring URL, pages visited, time spent on pages, and the date and time of your visit. This information is collected through server logs and analytics tools to help us understand how visitors use our site so we can improve the experience.</p>
            <p>If you choose to contact us through our contact form, we will collect the information you voluntarily provide, including your name, email address, and the content of your message. This information is used solely to respond to your inquiry and is not shared with any third parties.</p>

            <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>We use the non-personal information we collect for the following purposes: to operate and maintain the DigiBouquet website, to analyze usage trends and improve site performance, to monitor the overall health and security of our service, to understand which features and content are most useful to our visitors, and to detect and prevent technical issues or abuse. We do not sell, trade, or rent any user information to third parties. We do not use collected data to build personal profiles or to identify individual users.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>DigiBouquet uses certain third-party services that may collect information from visitors to our site. These services operate under their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.</p>
            <p><strong>Google AdSense:</strong> We use Google AdSense to display advertisements on our website. Google AdSense uses cookies and similar technologies to serve ads based on your prior visits to DigiBouquet and other websites across the internet. Google may collect and use data about your browsing activity to provide personalized advertising. You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Ads Settings</a>. For more information about how Google uses data when you use sites that display its ads, please visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Privacy and Terms page</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We may use Google Analytics to collect and analyze website traffic data. Google Analytics uses cookies to gather information about how visitors interact with our site. This data is aggregated and anonymized, meaning it does not personally identify individual users. You can opt out of Google Analytics tracking by installing the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.</p>

            <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
            <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit a website. DigiBouquet itself does not set any first-party cookies for tracking purposes. However, the third-party services we use, particularly Google AdSense, do place cookies on your device. These cookies are used to serve relevant advertisements, measure ad performance, and limit how many times you see a particular ad. Google AdSense cookies enable ad personalization based on your browsing history across the web. You can manage your cookie preferences through your browser settings. Most browsers allow you to block or delete cookies, though doing so may affect the functionality of some websites. You can also manage your ad personalization preferences through the Google Ads Settings page linked above.</p>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>Since DigiBouquet does not require user accounts and does not store personal information from bouquet creation, there is minimal data to retain. Server logs containing non-personal usage data are retained for a reasonable period necessary for security monitoring and site analytics, after which they are deleted. If you contact us through our contact form, we retain your message and contact details only for as long as needed to resolve your inquiry and for a reasonable period afterward for reference, unless you request earlier deletion.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>DigiBouquet is committed to protecting the privacy of children. Our website is intended for a general audience and is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), if we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take immediate steps to delete that information from our records. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal information to us, please contact us using the information below so we can take appropriate action.</p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information collected through our website from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. When we make changes, we will revise the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information. Your continued use of DigiBouquet after any changes to this policy constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

            <h2>Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please reach out to us through our <a href="/contact.html">Contact page</a>.
